            The superhero satire goes from strength to strength. Between the actors, the writers or the viewers, it's
            hard to say who's having the most fun

                    "With great power comes the absolute certainty that you'll turn into a right c**t."</strong> <br>

                That's what Billy Butcher says about Supes at one point in this eight-part third season of The Boys,
                though if this latest batch of episodes proves anything, it's that there's a lot more to many of these
                characters than meets the eye. Putting a greater emphasis on further exploring its leads, season 3
                doesn't move the overarching story along too far by the time all is said and done, but still delivers a
                satisfying, suitably f***ed up ride for fans who have been eagerly anticipating a return to this twisted
                world. With Billy more intent than ever to put an end to the world's Supes, Homelander's emotional state
                worsening to the point where he's a powder keg waiting to explode, and the introduction of Soldier Boy,
                it's good that the show decides to zero in on its characters because there are a lot of them, and The
                Boys occasionally struggles under their weight.

                    Having being all superheroed out with the never ending train of films this is so much welcome
                    relief. It's not for kids and I love the choice language which is appropriate.

                Overall, though, The Boys delivers a mostly satisfying experience over the course of its eight episodes,
                and while a more definitive creative direction is needed for season 4, this year at least sets the stage
                for that and does so by delivering its fair share of delightfully messed up moments that serve as a
                reminder of why this is still one of the most gloriously inventive TV shows you could hope to find.
