  <p>American businessman Thomas John Watson Sr. led IBM as its chairman and CEO.
    From 1914 through 1956, he managed the company's expansion into a global power.
    John Henry Patterson's training at NCR influenced Watson in creating IBM's management philosophy and organizational
    culture.
    He transformed the business into a highly successful sales organization that was heavily dependent on punched card
    tabulating equipment.
    He was a self-made industrialist who, upon his death in 1956, was hailed as the world's greatest salesman and one of
    the wealthiest individuals of his time.
